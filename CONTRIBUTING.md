This document provides some instructions for setting up a development environment for working on the front end of this module.  These steps assume that you are on a Debian/Ubuntu system (I was running Ubuntu 20.04) without any additional Node-related packages installed.  It should not require super-user privileges.

# Installation
1. Clone this repository and enter the package root with `cd flu_frequencies/web`.
2. The version of NodeJS provided with Ubuntu 20 is too old (v10.19.0).  To install a newer version that co-exists with the system version, I used [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).  Use one of the [installation script](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) provided by the developers.  This creates a hidden directory `.nvm` under `$HOME`.
   ```console
   art@Kestrel:~/git/flu_frequencies/web$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash

   => Compressing and cleaning up git repository
   
   => nvm source string already in /home/art/.bashrc
   => bash_completion source string already in /home/art/.bashrc
   => Close and reopen your terminal to start using nvm or run the following to use it now:
   
   export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
   [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
   [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
   ```
3. Open a new terminal window so that `$PATH` binary search path includes the `.nvm` directory.
4. We want to install the Node.js version specified in the hidden `.nvmrc` file.  (Currently the version number is `18.14.0`.)  To automatically install the required version, run `nvm install` and `nvm use`:
   ```console
   Downloading and installing node v18.14.0...
   Downloading https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.14.0/node-v18.14.0-linux-x64.tar.xz...
   ###################################################################################### 100.0%
   Computing checksum with sha256sum
   Checksums matched!
   Now using node v18.14.0 (npm v9.3.1)
   Creating default alias: default -> 18.14.0 (-> v18.14.0)
   ```
   You can confirm that you are running this new version with the following command:
   ```console
   art@Kestrel:~/git/flu_frequencies/web$ which node
   /home/art/.nvm/versions/node/v18.14.0/bin/node
   ```
5. The above step also installs the [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) `npm` in the same local directory.  Install the package dependencies by running `npm install` (if the package manager complains about conflicting dependencies, use a `-force` flag).
6. Install the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager: `npm install --global yarn`
7. Copy the environment variables with `cp .env.example .env`.
8. Run `yarn install` and `yarn dev` to start the server.
9. Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your web browser.
